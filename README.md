## Mod races/factions

Exogenesis contains four different races each with their own lore, weapons, defense, and units.

`Credits to ƒêuvent for making both the lore of the factions and the two attack maps`

`Genesux`: 
"In the 'Siravax System', they reside on the sub-zero temperature planet called 'Siratla'. Other planets in the system, comprised of Siratla Stone and Crystals, include Ruxt. Vantax is a Gas Planet. These three specific planets also have multiple satellites (moons) surrounding them. The star is Siravax, and the Genesux are composed of cold energy and Siratla stone. They are a type of lithoids, strong beings. Their weapons and creations are made out of metal materials formed from various metals and cold energy. Little is understood of their goal, but it seems like nothing is going to stop them from achieving it."

`Solran`: 
These lithoid lifeforms are almost the opposite of the Genesux, as they are extremely hot/molten and possess capabilities beyond this galaxy. They are found in the "Alphandax System," which presents an astronomical question, as it is a Binary System with Alphandax and Betanax, yet planets orbit around them. Moving on to these creatures, they are comprised of molten rock and material obtained from beneath the volcanoes and lava oceans of their planet, Volceru. They acquire titanium and multiple igneous rocks, fusing them together to create a robust material used to form their formidable monsters. Other satellites/planets in this Binary System include Furnius and Siten.

`Elecian`: 
They are found in the "Vanstarius System," residing on a gassy planet with three out of four satellites. Other planets in this system also have satellites: Ravu and Duris. Although Duris and Mineus lack satellites, we will still include them. The Elecians are monsters of destruction and show no mercy. Their technology is highly advanced and unmatched in their willingness to fight. They are very strong and can deliver a powerful blow, whether you have walls or not. The materials they use are unknown and are likely an alloy made from titanium and other substances.

`Quantra`: 
These peaceful aquatic plant creatures are found in the "Lumian System." They aren't observed as much as the others but have developed both underwater and on islands and shores. They inhabit a radioactive biome within an ocean, somehow obtaining materials to craft several naval weapons. They also invent other weapons capable of devastating everything around them.
